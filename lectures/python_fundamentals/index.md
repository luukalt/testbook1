# Python Fundamentals

In this section, we begin with the basics.

We will talk about what a programming language is and how computers use
them to perform operations.

We discuss why we chose the Python language for this course.

We learn about core concepts like variables, data-types, and
functions.

We will become familiar with the core data-types built into Python,
some standard functions we will frequently use, and learn how to define our own functions.

By the end, you should have a solid grasp on core Python
concepts, be prepared to study the next sections on numerical programming,
and feel comfortable handling data.
